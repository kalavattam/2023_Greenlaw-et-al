The following are key notes from reading Alison's QE proposal:
```txt
Antisense transcript classification schema:
    I. By length
        a. 3’ end only
        b. full gene
        c. into sense promotor
    II. By stability: "if a transcript is not above a certain threshold in input, it will be
        classified as rapidly degraded"

#QUESTION For II, what is the input? How will it be measured, assessed, and thresholded?
```
```txt
I. Schema for assessing "the interest" of antisense transcripts:
    a. high antisense transcription
    b. uniqueness to Q
    c. potential biological effect on Q if sense strand is transcribed

II. Home in on candidates from the above that...
    a. extend across the full length of sense gene
    b. appears to be "shorter 3’ transcript [that] looks like it could be inducing early
       termination of sense transcription"

#QUESTION How is antisense transcription evaluated to be "high" in Ia?
#QUESTION How to assess Ic?
#QUESTION How can you tell IIb just by looking at IGV tracks? You see the end of sense
          transcription in the 3' UTR together with the antisense transcription specific
          to/overlapping the 3' UTR?
```
`#QUESTION` Are these still accurate? Have they changed at all since writing them?


- `#IMPORTANT` Need a carefully defined, curated list of issues that we see in the results of transcriptome assembly, including visual examples
	- `#QUESTION` What do we see and how does that compare to what we expect/"want"?
	- I will put these together for a discussion with Brian Haas, who can guide us in what parts of the pipeline to change and/or what program (`Trinity` and/or `PASA`) parameters to tune
		+ Have touched base with Alison and Toshi about this; they're OK with me discussing the project and its issues, including evidence of the issues such as IGV screenshots
	- `#QUESTION` Does Alison have lab notebook entries and/or any other documentation that covers this? For example, from combing through IGV, did she take notes on what she was saw and found to be problematic?
		+ If so, it'd be great if she copied and sent that/those to me (if it's physical, then paper copies; if digital, then point to it on the tsukiyamalab server and/or message it to me)
		+ If not, it'd be great for Alison to do the following bullet
	- `#IMPORTANT` The most helpful thing for me, I think, would be Alison's rough notes that include the following: 
		+ documentation for a small number of "problem categories" that describe...
			* what the specific problem is, e.g., "There is transcription beyond a given part of a gene per the Ensembl `sacCer3` annotation"
			* what we expect and/or "want," e.g., "We expect/want this to be included in the annotation for that transcript after having run `Trinity`/`PASA`"
		+ IGV screenshots and/or genomic coordinates of examples
		+ quick and dirty notes would be just fine as long as they cover the important issues


- Other questions for Alison
    - `#QUESTION` Did she try running `Trinity` with other parameters? Did she record any of those experiments, save the outfiles, take notes on the issues from those, etc.?
    	+ If so, it'd be great to get those, including any observations, documentation, etc.
    	+ If not, no big deal
    - `#QUESTION` When evaluating nascent RNA expression, do we need to consider introns, splicing, etc. at all? Like, would we expect nascent or stready-state 4tU-seq signal to run into introns or skip them?
    - `#QUESTION` `#IMPORTANT` What are the detailed steps that Alison was taking to address and work with the subpar annotation? Alison mentioned implementing some set operations with `bedtools`...
    	+ `#TASK` It'd be great to get a systematic list of what Alison was trying to address and how she was trying to address it, including...
    		* the problems identified (itemized/categorized)
    		* the substeps for each step she was doing to address each problem
    		* whether that step was implemented in `bedtools` (or something) or was something she was addressing manually
    	+ basically, just need...
    		* the issues,
    		* the things to address each issue with any rationale, etc., and
    		* the logic or steps to do the thing that addresses it, regardless of whether the logic/steps are performed with a program or done by hand
    - `#QUESTION` I was assuming that steady-state 4tu-seq signal is the same as RNA-seq signal, but is that assumption correct? If not, then how are signals from each experiment different and in what ways?
    - Is there a reason Alison aligned her data with Bowtie 2, a non-splice-aware aligner, versus something like HISAT2 or STAR, both splice-aware aligners?
    - Is 4tU-seq signal, be it nascent and/or stead-state, more like, say, ChIP-seq signal than RNA-seq signal?
    - `#QUESTION` In Alison's genome-guided `Trinity`-assembled transcriptome (parameters from from Blevins et al. (Mar Alba), *bioRxiv* 2019-0313), are there *K. lactis* reads in these `fastq` files, in addition to *S. cerevisiae* reads?
    	+ `#ANSWER` Yes, and 20 S reads too (`#QUESTION` This is copied my notes from 2022-1025: Is this correct?)
