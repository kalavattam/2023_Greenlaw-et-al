## Prepare data for various DGE analyses
### Get situated
#### Set working directory
```{r Set working directory, results='hide', message=FALSE}
# p_local <- "/Users/kalavattam/Dropbox/FHCC"  # KrisMac
p_local <- "/Users/kalavatt/projects-etc"  # WorkMac
p_wd <- "2022_transcriptome-construction/results/2023-0215"
#NOTE 1/3 Alison: you can adjust 'p_local' or 'p_wd' (path to working directory 
#NOTE 2/3 on your personal or work computer ); I have two paths here with one
#NOTE 3/3 commented out depending on which computer I am using

setwd(paste(p_local, p_wd, sep = "/"))
getwd()

rm(p_local, p_wd)
```
<br />

#### Load necessary libraries
```{r Load necessary libraries, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
library(edgeR)
library(EnhancedVolcano)
library(GenomicRanges)
library(ggrepel)
library(IRanges)

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
